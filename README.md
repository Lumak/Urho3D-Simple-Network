# Urho3D Simple Network

Description
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First, let me say that this is a basic network example adapted from 17_SceneReplication and a project to help me understand more about Urho3D's networking feature. If you're advanced Urho3D network programmer, this might be too simple for you to review.  

The 17 scene replication example is very useful, but I wanted to extend it to:
* simulate client logging into a server with different gear and can be seen by all.
* simulate and verify swapping out gear in game and can be seen by all.
* create object oriented server class for reusability.

To Build
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To build it, unzip/drop the repository into your Urho3D/ folder and build it the same way as you'd build the default Samples that come with Urho3D.
**Built with Urho3D 1.7 tag.**
